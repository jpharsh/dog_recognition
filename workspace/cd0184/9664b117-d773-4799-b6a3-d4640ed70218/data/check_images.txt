Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The Alexnet architecture incorrectly classified the breed of Dog_01.jpg to be Malinois. Both the Resnet and VGG architectures correctly classified the image to be a German Shepherd. 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Alexnet identified Dog_01 as a Malinois and Dog_02 as a Rhodesian Ridgeback. Resnet classified Dog_01 as a German Shepherd and Dog_02 as a Bloodhound. VGG identified Dog_01 as a German Shepherd and Dog_02 as a Malinois.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01 and Object_Name_01 to be not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three architectures correctly identified when an image was not a dog, but only Resnet and VGG were able to correctly identify the breed of Dog_01. 
I would select the VGG architecture as the best for uploaded image classification as it's classification of Dog_02 was a more similar classifcation to Dog_01 than Resnet.
